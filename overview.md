# Insurance Database Analytics Project

## Objective
Perform analytics operations on an insurance database to uncover patterns, analyze trends, and derive actionable insights. Additionally, identify the factors influencing insurance charges.

---

## Dataset Structure
The dataset contains the following columns:

| **Parameter**         | **Description**                       | **Data Type**     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **age**               | Age of the individual (in years).    | Integer           |
| **gender**            | Gender of the individual (1 for Male, 2 for Female). | Integer |
| **bmi**               | Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of body fat. | Float |
| **no_of_children**    | Number of children the individual has. | Integer |
| **smoker**            | Indicates if the person smokes (0 for No, 1 for Yes). | Integer |
| **region**            | The U.S. region where the individual resides:  | Integer |
|                        | 1 = Northwest (NW), 2 = Northeast (NE), 3 = Southwest (SW), 4 = Southeast (SE). | |
| **charges**           | Annual insurance charges in USD.      | Float             |

## Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Exploration
- **Understand the data**:
  - Check the structure, dimensions, and basic statistics of the dataset.
  - Look for missing or inconsistent data.
  - Example questions:
    - What is the average insurance charge?
    - How many smokers are there in the dataset?

- **Visualizations**:
  - Plot distributions of numeric variables (e.g., `age`, `bmi`, `charges`).
  - Create bar charts for categorical variables like `gender`, `smoker`, and `region`.

---

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing or incorrect values:
  - Fill or remove missing values if any.
  - Ensure consistency in data types (e.g., integer for `gender` and `region`).
- Normalize/scale variables if necessary (e.g., `bmi` and `charges`).

---

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze relationships between variables:
  - **Correlation Analysis**:
    - Examine how variables like `age`, `bmi`, and `smoker` influence `charges`.
    - Use a heatmap to visualize correlations.
  - **Group Comparisons**:
    - Compare average charges for smokers vs. non-smokers.
    - Analyze differences in charges by `region` or `gender`.
  - **Visualization Examples**:
    - Scatter plot of `bmi` vs. `charges`.
    - Box plot of `charges` grouped by `smoker` status.
    - Line plot showing how `charges` change with age.

---

### 4. Statistical Analysis
- Use statistical tests to validate observations:
  - Is there a significant difference in charges between smokers and non-smokers?
  - Does BMI significantly affect insurance charges?

---

### 5. Predictive Analytics (Optional/Advanced)
- Build a **linear regression model** to predict `charges`:
  - Independent variables: `age`, `gender`, `bmi`, `no_of_children`, `smoker`, `region`.
  - Dependent variable: `charges`.
- Evaluate the model's performance (e.g., using R-squared or Mean Squared Error).

---

## Potential Insights
- Smoking significantly increases insurance charges.
- BMI has a positive correlation with insurance charges (higher BMI â†’ higher charges).
- Younger individuals or those in specific regions may pay lower premiums.
- Individuals with more children might have slightly higher or lower charges depending on other factors.

---

## Deliverables
- **Report/Dashboard**:
  - Summarize findings in an easy-to-read format with charts and key insights.
- **Code Notebook**:
  - Include the Python/R code used for analysis.
- **Prediction Model**:
  - If you implement a model, provide a brief summary of its accuracy and performance.

This project will help you apply core data analytics concepts such as data cleaning, EDA, and statistical analysis while also exploring potential predictive modeling techniques. Feel free to customize or expand upon this framework for your GitHub upload.
